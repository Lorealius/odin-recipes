    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>6 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>½ cup water</li>
      <li>1 cube chicken bouillon, crumbled</li>
      <li>1 ¼ cups heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>¾ cup milk</li>
      <li>4 green onions, sliced diagonally into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley, for garnish</li>
    </ul>


    <h1>Steps</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat butter, olive oil, and garlic in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Cook chicken in hot butter mixture until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove chicken to a plate to cool slightly, then slice diagonally into long strips. Reserve butter mixture in the pan.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook linguine in boiling water until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Reheat butter mixture in the pan over medium heat. Add onion and sauté, stirring often, until onion is soft but still white. Add water and bouillon; bring to a boil and simmer, uncovered, for about 10 minutes. Stir in cream, Parmesan cheese, milk, and green onions until sauce is well combined.</li>
        <li>Place linguine in a large bowl. Arrange chicken slices in a decorative pattern on top. Pour sauce over chicken and around linguine. Garnish with parsley to serve.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
