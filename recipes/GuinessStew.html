    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious Irish classical Dish</p>
    <p>As the name suggests, the Stew is topped up with a can of guiness for</p>
    <p>an enhanced and rich, cultural flavour</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1-2 tbsp of rapeseed oil</li>
      <li>1kg shoulder of beef, cut into one inch chunks</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>2 carrots, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>2 celery sticks, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, finely sliced</li>
      <li>150ml beef stock</li>
      <li>500ml of Guinness</li>
      <li>Sea salt and ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 bay leaf</li>
      <li>30g of plain flour</li>
    </ul>


    <h1>Steps</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot and brown the meat in two batches, be careful not to overcrowd the pan. Remove and set aside on a plate. Add another drop of oil if you need it and then fry off the onion, carrots and celery. Add the meat back into the pot along with the garlic.</li>
        <li>Pour in the stock, Guinness, one bay leaf and season to taste. Simmer gently for about 1 1/2 hours until the liquid has reduced. If the sauce isnâ€™t thick enough strain the juices into a bowl and then transfer to a small sauce pan.</li>
        <li>Mix a little of the sauce with the flour over heat until you have a smooth paste, then whisk through the rest of the liquid. Simmer gently until you have a thickened sauce, then tip back over the meat. Serve with mashed potatoes or crusty bread.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
